# NLP_with_Transfer_learning_BERT

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial technique in natural language processing that enables us to understand the emotional tone of text data. In this project, we utilize BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Bhasme/NLP_with_Transfer_learning_BERT`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
This project is divided into several parts:

Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Creating BERT Model: Building the BERT model using TensorFlow Hub.
Tokenization: Tokenizing the text data for BERT input.
Getting Embeddings: Generating BERT embeddings for analysis.
Training a Neural Network: Building and training a neural network for sentiment classification.
Creating a Data Pipeline: Building a pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on new data.
Follow the scripts provided in the repository to navigate through each step of the project.

## Results
The culmination of efforts leads to a comprehensive understanding of sentiment analysis and BERT's role in it. The final neural network achieves impressive results, and the data pipeline makes it easy to apply sentiment analysis on new data.
